# Ensemble-Modelling-and-Visualization-of-Data
## A Major and Minor Project built during Verzeo Internship

I have joined the Team Verzeo for the Internship between June-August 2020. 

## MINOR PROJECT

I have built a minor project where I have analysed, cleaned the data, detected outliers in it and performed the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the given dataset. However, I have written the code to answer the following questions 

1) Which are the movies with the third lowest and third highest budget?
2) What is the average number of words in movie titles between the year 2000-2005?
3) What is the most common Genre for Vin Diesel & Emma Watson movies?
4) Which are the movies with most and least earned revenue?
5) What is the average runtime of movies in the year 2006?
6) Name any 3 production companies which have invested money in worse revenue movies?

## MAJOR PROJECT

The major project assigned in this internship required me to build a Linear and Random Forest Regression model which predict the total number of COVID-19 cases in India. I worked on the project and built a Linear and Random Forest Regression model. I also performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data set given by Verzeo team (Link present in the code). Based on the observations, the project was successfully completed. When you enter a date, the model predicts the total cases of Corona virus in India. This is my first project based on Machine Learning. Glad to share it on GitHub as my contribution to open source.
